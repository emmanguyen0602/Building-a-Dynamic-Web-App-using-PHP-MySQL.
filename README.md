# Building a Dynamic Web App using PHP MySQL  
Note: All content and materials in this repo comes from [Coursera Guided Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dynamic-web-app-php-mysql/supplement/MhGNK/project-based-course-overview).  
## Objectives
- Create databases, users, and tables in MySQL and create the database connection in PHP.  
- Apply PHP knowledge to capture and secure input from user before sending it to the database.  
- Create the add, update, delete and retrieve functions in the PHP web app interacting with MySQL database.  
## Structure of the project  
### Task 1: Introduction
By the end of Task 1, you will be able to describe the case for using PHP and MySQL in Back-end Development. You will be able to analyze the requirements for the note-taking application developed throughout the project. You will be able to describe the development environment and be familiar with it.  
### Task 2: Preparing the Database  
By the end of Task 2, you will be able to create user accounts, databases, and tables in MySQL through the phpmyadmin interface. You will be able to apply the requirement analyzed to specify the table schema and different fields.
### Task 3: Database Connection
By the end of Task 3, you will be able to create a database connection using PHP. You will be able to describe the different arguments required to initiate a connection from PHP to MySQL.  
### Task 4: Capturing User Input
By the end of Task 4, you will be able to apply PHP and HTML knowledge to capture input data from the user. You will be able to evaluate the difference between the GET and POST HTTP methods.  
### Task 5: Adding Records to the Database
By the end of Task 5, you will be able to create a webpage that adds new content into the backend database.  
### Task 6: Retrieving Records from the Database
By the end of Task 6, you will be able to apply PHP and MySQL techniques to retrieve data from the database and dynamically change the HTML layout accordingly.  
### Task 7: Deleting Records and Security
By the end of Task 7, you will be able to create the delete functionality, which deletes records from the database using PHP. You will be able to analyze some security threats while accepting data from the user. You will be able to understand how to validate input data from the user.  
### Task 8: Updating Records
By the end of Task 8, you will be able to create the “update” functionality in the app, which allows users to edit previously existing content in the database.
